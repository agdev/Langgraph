# API Key Configuration Loader Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the API key configuration loader feature.

## Status: Implemented

## Tasks

- [x] Create `utils/config_loader.py` module
- [x] Integrate with existing `set_api_keys()` function
- [x] Add python-dotenv to dependencies
- [x] Create a template .env file
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Test with various configurations

## Implementation Notes

### Date: 2025-04-15

Initial planning completed. Created plan document outlining the approach for loading API keys from `.env` files.

### Date: 2025-04-18

Implementation completed:

1. Created `utils/config_loader.py` module with two main functions:
   - `load_environment_variables()`: Loads environment variables from .env files in multiple possible locations
   - `create_config_from_env()`: Creates a Config object from environment variables based on the selected provider

2. Updated `set_api_keys()` function in `app.py` to:
   - Detect when the provider has changed
   - Reset the compiled graph when the provider changes
   - Try to load API keys from environment variables for the selected provider
   - Only show the API key input UI if environment variables aren't found
   - Reset the compiled graph when new API keys are loaded or entered

3. Created a template .env file at `env/.env.template` with examples for all provider API keys

4. Added python-dotenv to dependencies

The implementation ensures that:
1. API keys are loaded from environment variables if available
2. The workflow is always recompiled with the correct provider when the provider changes
3. Users can still manually enter API keys if environment variables aren't found

The plan has been updated to better match the existing code structure:

1. Create a `config_loader.py` module with functions to load environment variables and create a Config object
2. Modify the existing `set_api_keys()` function to first try loading keys from the `.env` file
3. Add python-dotenv to the project dependencies
4. Create a template .env file for users
5. Update documentation

The implementation will respect the existing flow and use the Config class that's already in place. The keys will be propagated through the existing flow once loaded.

### Date: 2025-04-15 (Update)

The plan has been updated to account for multiple LLM providers:

1. The `load_environment_variables()` function now returns API keys for all providers (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic)
2. The `create_config_from_env()` function selects the appropriate API key based on the provider
3. The `set_api_keys()` function tries to load keys for the currently selected provider
4. The template .env file includes all provider API keys with comments
5. The documentation has been updated to explain how provider selection works

### Date: 2025-04-15 (Update 2)

The plan has been further updated to handle provider switching:

1. The `set_api_keys()` function now detects when the provider has changed
2. When a provider change is detected, the compiled graph is reset
3. The function then tries to load keys for the newly selected provider
4. This ensures that when a user switches providers, the system checks for environment variables for the new provider
5. The workflow compilation process is restarted with the new provider

### Date: 2025-04-15 (Update 3)

Fixed a critical bug in the provider switching logic:

1. Identified a bug where changing providers wouldn't trigger workflow recompilation
2. Updated the plan to ensure the compiled graph is reset in two scenarios:
   - When the provider is changed in the UI
   - When API keys are loaded from environment variables
   - When API keys are manually entered and saved
3. This ensures that the workflow is always recompiled with the correct provider
4. Without this fix, the application would continue using the previously compiled workflow with the old provider

## Challenges and Solutions
