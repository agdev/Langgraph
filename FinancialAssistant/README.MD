## üåü Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Financial Data**: Get up-to-date stock prices, income statements, and company information
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically determines the most appropriate financial data to retrieve
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Combines multiple data sources into coherent financial reports
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with Groq, OpenAI, or Anthropic LLMs

### New Features
- **Cross-Thread Memory Management**: Remembers companies and context between user interactions
- **Conversation Summarization**: Maintains an evolving summary of the conversation history
- **Symbol Persistence**: Remembers previously discussed stock symbols for more natural follow-up questions
- **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Uses conversation history to provide more relevant responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Orchestration**: Langgraph for agent workflow management
- **LLM Providers**: GROQ with Llama 3.1 (default), OpenAI, or Anthropic
- **Financial Data**: Financial Modeling Prep API
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Testing**: Pytest with comprehensive unit and integration tests

### System Components
1. **Router**: Analyzes user requests to determine the appropriate handling path
2. **Symbol Extraction**: Identifies company stock symbols in user requests
3. **Data Retrieval Nodes**: Fetch financial data from external APIs
4. **Report Generation**: Combines data into comprehensive reports
5. **Memory Manager**: Maintains conversation context across sessions
6. **Summarization**: Creates and updates conversation summaries for context awareness

### Workflow
![Financial Assistant Workflow](financial_data_report_graph.png)

## üí° How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user submits a financial data request or question
2. **Request Analysis**: The system determines if the request is for a specific financial data point, a comprehensive report, or a general chat response
3. **Symbol Extraction**: The system extracts the relevant company symbol or falls back to the last discussed symbol
4. **Data Retrieval**: For financial requests, the system fetches the requested data from the Financial Modeling Prep API
5. **Response Generation**: The system formats the data into a readable response or generates a comprehensive report
6. **Memory Update**: The conversation is summarized and stored for future context

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Financial Modeling Prep API key
- LLM provider API key (GROQ, OpenAI, or Anthropic)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FinancialAssistant.git
   cd FinancialAssistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r streamlit_app/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure API keys
   Create a `.env` file in the `streamlit_app/env` directory with:
   ```
   FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üß† Memory Management System

The new memory management system enables:

- **Continuity**: The assistant remembers your previous questions about specific companies
- **Context Awareness**: Follow-up questions can reference previously discussed data
- **Symbol Persistence**: Ask "What about their income statement?" after discussing a company
- **Evolving Understanding**: The conversation summary adapts as you explore different financial topics
